This folder contains the main scripts of the project. These scripts were using for parsing the raw files that were eventually used as the input/output for the machine learning algorithms.
The "tryingKeras" notebook contains the instructions for running a Keras neural network with Pfam counts.
The "optimisedPaperFormula" notebook contains the instructions for running the IOKR algorithm with Pfam counts.
The input/output files can be found in the files folder.
